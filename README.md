# Javascript SDKs for Skylab

## Overview

This is the repo for Javascript based SDKs for Skylab, Amplitude's experimentation and feature
management platform. Skylab supports both browser and node environments. Both browser and node SDK implementations share common libraries in `/lib/core`, and provide environment specific functionality
through the `SkylabClient` constructor.

## Getting Started

Please see the package documentation for getting started with each SDK:

- [Browser](packages/browser/README.md)
- [Node](packages/node/README.md)
