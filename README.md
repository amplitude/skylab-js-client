# Javascript Client (Browser) SDK for Skylab

## Overview

This is the Javascript client (web browser) SDK for Skylab, Amplitude's
experimentation and feature management platform.

## Browser Compatibility

This SDK works with all major browsers and IE10+. The SDK does make use of
Promises, so if you are targeting a browser that does not have native support
for Promise (for example, IE), you should include a polyfill for Promise, (for
example, [es6-promise](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise)).

## Getting Started

Refer to the [Javascript SDK Documentation](https://amplitude-lab.readme.io/docs/javascript-client-sdk) to get started.
